# Gmod-Client-Side-Extractor
Extracts cached lua scripts sent to the client from the server.

**Usage**
```gcse -g <gmod directory> -o <output directory>```

**Example**
```gcse -g "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod" -o "C:\extracted"```

This tool will not restore the origional file names for the scripts, but will make their content readable.
